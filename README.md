# local-llm-finance-analyzer-v1

### Summary

This project uses Meta’s latest LLaMA 3.2 model running locally to analyze a user’s personal bank transactions. The transaction dataset was generated by Claude.ai, and the prompt used is fairly simple, leading to basic categorization. While the current version isn’t highly “intelligent,” it serves as a foundational step toward more personalized and sophisticated financial analysis. Future updates will involve making the local LLaMA model more intelligent and tailored to each user’s specific transaction behavior.

### Tech Details

	1.	LLM Model: Local LLaMA 3.2
	2.	Programming Language: Python 3

### Future Enhancements

The next version of this project will improve LLaMA’s ability to understand and categorize transactions based on individual user behavior. This will include refining prompts, training the model on custom datasets, and making the output more context-aware.

### Note

This project was inspired by @thu-vu92, whose original repo provided valuable insight and inspiration for this implementation.
